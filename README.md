# briefscss

briefscss is a CSS framework built for me and my personal projects. However, it
has a strong emphasis on code quality and modularity, which makes it an apt fit
for other projects too.

Like Bulma, Briefs is designed with readable CSS classes and sensible code
design in mind. Briefs also uses no JS components. However, Briefs opts for
different design choices (no `is-danger`, just `is-red`). Furthermore, the code
opts to be more programmatically generated using variables, reducing the size
of the source.

Ultimately, Brief attempts to trim the fat of larger CSS projects while also
allowing developers to add touches of their own more easily on top of what
already exists.

It remains practically unusable right now for anyone except me due to its lack
of documentation, but fear not, it is coming soon.
