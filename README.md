# briefscss

breifscss is a CSS framework designed for simplicity and extensibility.

Like Bulma, briefs is designed with readable CSS classes and sensible code
design in mind. briefs uses no JS components. However, briefs opts for different
design choices (no `is-danger`, just `is-red`). Furthermore, the code is more
programmatically generated than Bulma, making it, in some senses, more
customizable.

Ultimately, briefs attempts to trim the fat of larger CSS projects while also
allowing developers to add touches of their own more easily on top of what
already exists.

It remains practically unusable right now for anyone except me due to its lack
of documentation, but fear not, it is coming soon.
